## File Size Comparison

### Old Splash Assets
```
desktop-splash.mp4:     ~1-5 MB (video file)
mobileSplash.webp:      ~100-300 KB
Total:                  ~1-5 MB
```

### New Cubic Splash Assets
```
cubic-splash.html:      ~2 KB
cubic-splash.css:       ~8 KB
cubic-splash.js:        ~6 KB
Total:                  ~16 KB (plus camera images from cache)
```

**Note:** New splash is much smaller in file size! The images it displays are already being loaded for your main app anyway.

## User Experience Flow

### Old Splash Flow
```
1. App loads
2. Video/image plays (fixed 2-3 sec)
3. Fades out
4. Main app appears
```
Simple but disconnected from actual app loading.

### New Cubic Splash Flow
```
1. App loads
2. Cubic splash appears
3. Fetches camera data (same as main app needs)
4. Progressively fills 3D grid with camera images
5. Shows loading progress (0% → 100%)
6. Reveals grid with animation
7. Transitions to main app (when everything is ready)
```
Engaging AND functional - keeps user entertained while data loads.

## Which Should You Use?

### Use Original Splash If:
- You want maximum simplicity
- You prefer a fixed, cinematic introduction
- You don't want to show app data during loading
- You have a very fast loading app (< 2 seconds)

### Use New Cubic Splash If:
- You want a modern, impressive visual effect
- You want to show actual camera images during loading
- You want adaptive timing based on actual loading progress
- You want something unique and memorable
- You want to engage users during longer loading times

---

## Can I Use Both?

Yes! Here are some scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Cubic for PWA, Original for Web
```javascript
// In cubic-splash.js, detect if running as PWA
if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  // Show cubic splash (installed app)
} else {
  // Redirect to simple splash (web browser)
  window.location.href = 'simple-splash.html';
}
```

### Scenario 2: First Visit vs Returning
```javascript
// Show cubic splash only on first visit
if (!localStorage.getItem('hasSeenCubicSplash')) {
  // Show cubic splash
  localStorage.setItem('hasSeenCubicSplash', 'true');
} else {
  // Show simple splash or skip to main app
}
```

### Scenario 3: Random Choice
```javascript
// 50/50 chance of each splash
if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
  // Show cubic splash
} else {
  // Show original splash
}
```

---

## Migration Path

If you want to test the new splash without fully committing:

### Step 1: Test Independently
Keep both splash screens. Access cubic splash at `/cubic-splash.html` directly.

### Step 2: A/B Test
Use one of the scenarios above to show different splashes to different users or situations.

### Step 3: Full Migration
Once satisfied, update `manifest.json` to use cubic splash as default.

### Step 4: Cleanup (Optional)
After confirming the new splash works well, you can optionally remove old splash assets to save space.

## Performance Impact

### Initial Load (First Visit)
- **Old:** Fast (video/image cached)
- **New:** Slightly slower (loads camera data + renders 3D grid)

### Subsequent Loads (Cached)
- **Old:** Very fast (video/image from cache)
- **New:** Very fast (HTML/CSS/JS + images all from cache)

### Perceived Performance
- **Old:** User waits with static content
- **New:** User engaged with progressive loading and real data

**Winner:** New splash provides better perceived performance because users see progress and real app data.

## Recommendation

🎯 **Go with the new cubic splash!** Here's why:

1. **More Engaging:** 3D effect is impressive and modern
2. **Functional:** Shows real loading progress
3. **Data-Driven:** Displays actual camera images
4. **Adaptive:** Finishes when ready, not on fixed timer
5. **Customizable:** Easy to tweak for your needs
6. **Smaller:** Less file size than video
7. **Unique:** Stands out from typical splash screens

You can always fall back to the original if needed, but the cubic splash provides a much richer user experience while serving a functional purpose (buying time for data loading).

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs
- Cubic splash appears on app load
- 3D grid fills with camera images
- Progress shows 0% → 100%
- Auto-redirects to index.html
- Main app appears without second splash
- Skip button works
- No console errors

### ❌ Bad Signs (Need to Fix)
- Old video/image splash appears
- Double splash (cubic + old)
- Errors in console
- Redirect fails
- Service worker stuck on old version
- Images don't load

---

## 🐛 Quick Fixes

### If old splash still appears:
```bash
# Solution 1: Hard refresh
Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)

# Solution 2: Clear cache
DevTools → Application → Clear storage

# Solution 3: Unregister service worker
DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister
```

### If cubic splash doesn't appear:
```bash
# Check manifest.json has:
"start_url": "./cubic-splash.html"

# Check cubic-splash.html exists
# Check service worker includes cubic files
```

### If stuck on old service worker:
```bash
# Force update
DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Update

# Or increment version in sw.js
const CACHE_VERSION = 'v46'; // bump version
```

## 🎨 Optional Customization Before Deploy

Consider customizing these before going live:

### Colors
```css
/* In cubic-splash.css */
--theme-clr: #4C4E52;    /* Your brand color */
color: #04AA6D;           /* Accent color */
```

### Text
```html
<!-- In cubic-splash.html -->
<h2>UDOT<span>Cameras</span></h2>
<p>Loading <span>traffic cameras</span>...</p>
```

### Timing
```javascript
// In cubic-splash.js
density = 5;              // Grid size
speed = 150;              // Loading speed
```

Use `cubic-splash-tester.html` to find perfect settings!

### After (Cubic Splash)
- Entry: cubic-splash.html
- Load time: ~5-7 seconds (adaptive)
- File size: 19 KB (+ camera images)
- User engagement: High (interactive + progress)

## ⚙️ Default Configuration

The splash is configured with balanced settings:

```javascript
density = 5              // 5×5 grid (100 total tiles)
speed = 150              // 150ms between tile loads
imageCount = 50          // Uses 50 random camera images
revealDuration = 1500    // 1.5 second reveal animation
pauseBeforeTransition = 500  // 0.5 second pause before transition
```

**Estimated total time:** ~5-7 seconds (perfect for data loading)

---

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### 1. Skip Button
- Located top-right corner
- Always visible
- Instantly jumps to main app
- Great for returning users who've seen the splash

### 2. Progress Indicator
- Shows 0-100% loading progress
- Updates as tiles populate
- Gives users feedback on loading status

### 3. Real Camera Images
- Automatically fetches from your `cameras.geojson`
- Uses up to 50 random camera images (configurable)
- Falls back to sample images if data unavailable
- Different every time you load the app

### 4. 3D Perspective
- Four walls create a "room" effect
- Smooth CSS 3D transforms
- Reveal animation pulls walls back
- Works great on all modern browsers

### 5. Adaptive Timing
- Doesn't transition until all tiles are loaded
- Ensures main app data is ready
- No fixed delays - responsive to actual loading time

---

## 📝 Quick Customization Cheat Sheet

### Make it Faster
```javascript
density = 3         // Fewer tiles
speed = 100         // Faster loading
imageCount = 30     // Fewer images
```

### Make it More Dramatic
```javascript
density = 7         // More tiles
speed = 250         // Slower, more suspenseful
imageCount = 80     // More variety
revealDuration = 2500  // Longer reveal
```

### Change Text
Edit `cubic-splash.html`:
```html
<h2>UDOT<span>Cameras</span></h2>
<p>Loading <span>traffic cameras</span> across Utah...</p>
```

### Change Colors
Edit `cubic-splash.css`:
```css
--theme-clr: #4C4E52;      /* Background */
color: #04AA6D;             /* Accent */
border-top-color: #04AA6D;  /* Spinner */
```

## 🎨 Visual Flow

```
User Opens App
      ↓
Cubic Splash Loads
      ↓
Shows "UDOT Cameras - Loading..."
      ↓
Fetches camera.geojson data
      ↓
Displays 3D grid (4 walls)
      ↓
Progressively fills tiles with images (0% → 100%)
      ↓
All tiles loaded
      ↓
Reveal animation (walls pull back)
      ↓
Brief pause

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The splash is fully optimized for mobile:
- Smaller font sizes on mobile
- Touch-friendly skip button
- Optimized grid density
- Smooth animations on touch devices
- Handles slow connections gracefully

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Splash doesn't appear
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Images don't load
**Solution:** Check that `cameras.geojson` is accessible. Opens DevTools console for errors.

### Issue: Takes too long
**Solution:** Use the tester to reduce density and speed values.

### Issue: Want to revert
**Solution:** 
1. Change `manifest.json` start_url back to `./`
2. Update `sw.js` version to v45
3. Clear cache

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understand the Code
- **HTML:** Simple structure with semantic elements
- **CSS:** CSS Grid, 3D transforms, animations
- **JavaScript:** ES6 modules, async/await, DOM manipulation
- **PWA:** Service workers, manifest, caching strategy

### CSS 3D Transforms
The magic happens with these CSS properties:
- `perspective: 1000px` - Creates 3D space
- `transform-style: preserve-3d` - Maintains 3D on children
- `rotateX()`, `rotateY()` - Rotates walls into position
- `transform-origin` - Sets rotation pivot point

### Progressive Loading
Images appear in random order:
1. Select random unloaded tile
2. Assign random camera image
3. Add 'loaded' class (triggers fade-in)
4. Update progress counter
5. Repeat until all tiles loaded

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Test the splash (`cubic-splash.html`)
2. ⚙️ Customize with tester (`cubic-splash-tester.html`)
3. 🎨 Adjust colors/text to your brand
4. 📱 Test on mobile device

### Short-term
1. 🧪 A/B test with users
2. 📊 Monitor performance
3. 🔧 Fine-tune timing based on feedback
4. 🎯 Consider adding more interactive elements

### Advanced Ideas
1. **Click to Explore:** Make tiles clickable to jump to that camera
2. **Category Filter:** Show only certain routes during splash
3. **Time-based:** Different splash for day/night
4. **Weather Integration:** Show weather data alongside cameras
5. **User Preferences:** Remember if user prefers to skip
